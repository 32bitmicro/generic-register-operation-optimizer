== Groups

A group collects registers together with a xref:read_write.adoc#_buses[bus]. A
bus provides read and write functionality. Like registers and fields, groups can
resolve paths.

[source,cpp]
----
struct bus { /* ... */ };

using F = groov::field<"field", std::uint32_t, 0, 0>;
using R = groov::reg<"reg", std::uint32_t, 0, F>;
using G = groov::group<"group", bus, R>;

// r has type F
auto r = groov::resolve(G{}, "reg.field"_f);
----

=== Combining groups with paths

The combination of a group and one or more paths forms a specification for
reading or writing.

[source,cpp]
----
constexpr auto grp = G{};

// Use operator/ to combine a single path
auto r_spec = grp / "reg"_r;
auto w_spec = grp / ("reg"_r = 42);

// alternatively, or for multiple paths:
auto r_spec = grp("reg1"_r, "reg2"_r);
auto w_spec = grp("reg1"_r = 42, "reg2"_r = 17);
